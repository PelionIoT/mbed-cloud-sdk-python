1.2.7.968 (2018-03-27)
======================

Features
--------

- Add subscriptions High Level Abstraction. Provides access to device
  registration status notifications. Sends request to terminate long poll on
  'stop_notifications'. (#722)


1.2.6.852 (2018-03-08)
======================

Features
--------

- Support Connector Enrollment Service API in SDK. Capabilities include:
  Account Admin can upload a list of Device IDs to claim, and can view the
  status of claimed devices. Make a new device claim using:
  `mbed_cloud.EnrollmentAPI().add_enrollment_claim(enrollment_identity=YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN)`.
  (#627)

- The HTTP header User-Agent is now configured by the SDK and contains version
  and basic platform information, which is passed to the Mbed Cloud. (#634)

Bugfixes
--------

- ConnectAPI: Add a timeout parameter to `set_resource_value` and
  `execute_resource_value` (#1015)

- Fix for list_campaign_device_states using outdated api (#1022)

- ConnectAPI: Use a different api backend for consistency when retrieving
  resource values. `set_resource_value`/`set_resource_value_async` no longer
  execute a resource (use `execute_resource` instead). (#604)

- SDKs now iterate subscriptions in order to delete them. (#733)

- Use correct API for updating campaign objects (#953)

Changes
~~~~~~~

-  Filter construction logic reworked
-  Added webhook notification handler
-  AsyncConsumer.wait()
-  Various bugfixes

.. _known-issues-1:

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Testing shows that ``get_resource_value`` will fail when the cloud
   service returns a value directly, rather than through an open
   notification channel. This affects all previous versions.
-  The only known workaround at present is to ensure the cloud cache is
   not used by:

   -  Waiting between calls to get_resource_value
   -  Reducing `the configured TTL`_ on the cloud client image on the
      device
