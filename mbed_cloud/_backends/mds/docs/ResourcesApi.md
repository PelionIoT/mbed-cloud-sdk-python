> AsyncID v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_delete(device_id, _resource_path, no_resp=no_resp)

Delete a resource

A request to delete a resource must be handled by both mbed Cloud Client and mbed Cloud Connect. The resource is not deleted from mbed Cloud Connect until the delete is handled by mbed Cloud Client.  All resource APIs are asynchronous. These APIs respond only if the device is turned on and connected to mbed Cloud Connect. 

### Example 
```python
from __future__ import print_statement
import time
import mds
from mds.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: Bearer
mds.configuration.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# mds.configuration.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = mds.ResourcesApi()
device_id = 'device_id_example' # str | A unique mbed Cloud device ID for the endpoint. Note that the ID must be an exact match. You cannot use wildcards here. 
_resource_path = '_resource_path_example' # str | The URL of the resource. 
no_resp = true # bool | **Non-confirmable requests**  All resource APIs have the parameter noResp. If you make a request with `noResp=true`, mbed Cloud Connect makes a CoAP non-confirmable request to the device. Such requests are not guaranteed to arrive in the device, and you do not get back an async-response-id.  If calls with this parameter enabled succeed, they return with the status code 204 No Content. If the underlying protocol does not support non-confirmable requests, or if the endpoint is registered in queue mode, the response is status code 409 Conflict.  (optional)

try: 
    # Delete a resource
    api_response = api_instance.v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_delete(device_id, _resource_path, no_resp=no_resp)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling ResourcesApi->v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_delete: %s\n" % e)
```

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **device_id** | **str**| A unique mbed Cloud device ID for the endpoint. Note that the ID must be an exact match. You cannot use wildcards here.  | 
 **_resource_path** | **str**| The URL of the resource.  | 
 **no_resp** | **bool**| **Non-confirmable requests**  All resource APIs have the parameter noResp. If you make a request with &#x60;noResp&#x3D;true&#x60;, mbed Cloud Connect makes a CoAP non-confirmable request to the device. Such requests are not guaranteed to arrive in the device, and you do not get back an async-response-id.  If calls with this parameter enabled succeed, they return with the status code 204 No Content. If the underlying protocol does not support non-confirmable requests, or if the endpoint is registered in queue mode, the response is status code 409 Conflict.  | [optional]

# **v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_get**
> AsyncID v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_get(device_id, _resource_path, cache_only=cache_only, no_resp=no_resp)

Read from a resource

Requests the resource value and when the response is available, a json AsycResponse  object (AsyncIDResponse object) is received in the notification channel. Note that you can also  receive notifications when a resource changes. The preferred way to get resource values is to use subscribe  and callback methods.  All resource APIs are asynchronous. These APIs will only respond  if the device is turned on and connected to mbed Cloud Connect. 

### Example 
```python
from __future__ import print_statement
import time
import mds
from mds.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: Bearer
mds.configuration.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# mds.configuration.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'

# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = mds.ResourcesApi()
device_id = 'device_id_example' # str | Unique mbed Cloud device ID for the endpoint. Note that the ID needs to be an exact match. You cannot use wildcards here. 
_resource_path = '_resource_path_example' # str | The URL of the resource. 
cache_only = true # bool | If true, the response comes only from the cache. Default: false.  (optional)
no_resp = true # bool | **Non-confirmable requests**   All resource APIs have the parameter `noResp`. If a request is made with `noResp=true`, mbed Cloud Connect makes a CoAP  non-confirmable request to the device. Such requests are not guaranteed to arrive in the device, and you do not get back  an async-response-id.  If calls with this parameter enabled succeed, they return with the status code 204 No Content. If the underlying protocol  does not support non-confirmable requests, or if the endpoint is registered in queue mode, the response is status code  409 Conflict.  (optional)

try: 
    # Read from a resource
    api_response = api_instance.v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_get(device_id, _resource_path, cache_only=cache_only, no_resp=no_resp)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling ResourcesApi->v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_get: %s\n" % e)
```

> AsyncID v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_post(device_id, _resource_path, resource_function=resource_function, no_resp=no_resp)

Execute a function on a resource

With this API, you can execute a function on an existing resource.  All resource APIs are asynchronous. These APIs respond only if the device is turned on and connected to mbed Cloud Connect. 

### Example 
```python
from __future__ import print_statement
import time
import mds
from mds.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure API key authorization: Bearer
mds.configuration.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

device_id = 'device_id_example' # str | A unique mbed Cloud device ID for the endpoint. Note that the ID must be an exact match. You cannot use wildcards here. 
_resource_path = '_resource_path_example' # str | The URL of the resource.
resource_function = 'resource_function_example' # str | This value is not needed. Most of the time resources do not accept a function but they have their own functions predefined. You can use this to trigger them.  If a function is included, the body of this request is passed as a char* to the function in mbed Cloud Client.  (optional)
no_resp = true # bool | **Non-confirmable requests**  All resource APIs have the parameter noResp. If you make a request with `noResp=true`, mbed Cloud Connect makes a CoAP non-confirmable request to the device. Such requests are not guaranteed to arrive in the device, and you do not get back an async-response-id.  If calls with this parameter enabled succeed, they return with the status code 204 No Content. If the underlying protocol does not support non-confirmable requests, or if the endpoint is registered in queue mode, the response is status code 409 Conflict.  (optional)

# **v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_put**
> AsyncID v2_endpoints_device_id_resource_path_put(device_id, _resource_path, resource_value, no_resp=no_resp)

Write to a resource

With this API, you can write new values to existing resources, or create new  resources on the device. The resource-path does not have to exist - it can be  created by the call. The maximum length of resource-path is 255 characters.  This API can also be used to transfer files to the device. mbed Cloud Connect LWM2M server implements the Option 1 from RFC7959. The maximum block size is 1024 bytes. The block size versus transferred file size is something to note in low quality networks. The customer application needs to know what type of file is transferred (for example txt) and the payload can be encrypted by the customer. The maximum size of payload is 1048576 bytes.  All resource APIs are asynchronous. These APIs respond only if the device is turned on and connected to mbed Cloud Connect.
