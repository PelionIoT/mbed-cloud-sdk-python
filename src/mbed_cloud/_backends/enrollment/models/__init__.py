    Enrollment API

    Connect Enrollment Service allows users to claim the ownership of a device which is not yet assigned to an account. A device without an assigned account can be a device purchased from the open market (OEM dealer) or a device transferred from an account to another. More information in [Device ownership: First-to-claim](/docs/current/connecting/device-ownership-first-to-claim-by-enrollment-list.html) document.
