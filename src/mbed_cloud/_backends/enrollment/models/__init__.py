    Enrollment API

    Mbed Cloud Connect Enrollment Service allows users to claim the ownership of a device which is not yet assigned to an account. A device without an assigned account can be a device purchased from the open market (OEM dealer) or a device transferred from an account to another. More information in [Device ownership: First-to-claim](https://cloud.mbed.com/docs/current/connecting/device-ownership.html) document.
