    Enrollment API

    Mbed Cloud Connect Enrollment Service allows users to claim the ownership of a device which is not yet assigned to an account. A device without an assigned account can be a device purchased from the open market (OEM dealer) or a device trasferred from an account to another. More information in [Device overship: First-to-claim](TODO: link needed) document.
