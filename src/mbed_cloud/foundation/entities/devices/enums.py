.. warning::
    Enums should not be imported directly from this module as the organisation of categories may change in
    the future, please use the :mod:`mbed_cloud.foundation.enums` module to import enums.

Devices Enums
=============

This module contains all Enums used by Foundation Entities in the Devices category:

- :class:`DeviceDeployedStateEnum`
- :class:`DeviceEnrollmentBulkCreateStatusEnum`
- :class:`DeviceEnrollmentBulkDeleteStatusEnum`
- :class:`DeviceEnrollmentOrderEnum`
- :class:`DeviceMechanismEnum`
- :class:`DeviceStateEnum`

------------

How to import Enums:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceDeployedStateEnum
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceEnrollmentBulkCreateStatusEnum
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceEnrollmentBulkDeleteStatusEnum
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceEnrollmentOrderEnum
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceMechanismEnum
    from mbed_cloud.foundation.enums import DeviceStateEnum
