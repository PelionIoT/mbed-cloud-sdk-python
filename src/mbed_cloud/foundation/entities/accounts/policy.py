.. warning::
    Policy should not be imported directly from this module as the
    organisation may change in the future, please use the :mod:`mbed_cloud.foundation` module to import entities.

Foundation Entity: Policy
=========================

The Policy entity does not have any methods, all actions must be performed via
the encapsulating entity.

Entity Usage and Importing
--------------------------

The recommended way of working with Entities is via the SDK Interface which will return an instance of an Entity which
will share the same context as other Entities. There is more information in the :mod:`mbed_cloud.sdk.sdk` module.

.. code-block:: python

    from mbed_cloud import SDK
    pelion_dm_sdk = SDK()
    policys = pelion_dm_sdk.foundation.policy()

How to import Policy directly:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from mbed_cloud.foundation import Policy
