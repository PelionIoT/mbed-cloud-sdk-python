```
$ pip install mbed-cloud-sdk
```

### Known Issues

- Testing shows that `get_resource_value` will fail
when the cloud service returns a value directly, rather than
through an open notification channel. This affects all previous versions.
- The only known workaround at present is to ensure the cloud cache is not used by:
  - Waiting between calls to get_resource_value
  - Reducing [the configured TTL](https://cloud.mbed.com/docs/latest/collecting/handle-resources.html#working-with-the-server-cache) on the cloud client image on the device
