        on a device.


        The `async-id` is provided by the client, enabling the client to track the
        end-to-end flow with an identifier

        that is relevant to the end application. For example, a web application''s
        session ID along with the device ID

        and the resource path could be used as the `async-id`. This also avoids any
        race conditions with

        [the notification channel](/docs/current/integrate-web-app/event-notification.html).
        All responses are sent through the

        currently configured notification channel as an **AsyncIDResponse**.


        For `GET` methods, values may be fetched from an internal cache, instead of
        contacting the device.


        See also /v2/endpoints/{device-id}/{resourcePath}.

        \nOne possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a\

        \nA callback can expire when Device Management cannot deliver a notification\
        \ due to a connection timeout or an\nerror response (4xx or 5xx). After each\
        \ delivery failure, Device Management sets an exponential back off time and\
        \ makes a retry attempt\nafter that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then\
        \ 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes.\nThe\
        \ callback URL will be removed if all retries fail within 24 hours. More about\
        \ [notification sending logic](/docs/current/integrate-web-app/event-notification.html#notification-sending-logic).\n\
        \n**Supported callback URL protocols:**\n\nCurrently, only HTTP and HTTPS\
        \ protocols are supported.\n\n**HTTPS callback URLs:**\n\nWhen delivering\

          \n###### On date-time fields:\n\nDate-time fields should be specified in\
          \ UTC RFC3339 format ```YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ```. There are three permitted\n\
          variations:\n\n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds e.g. 2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z\n\
          * UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds e.g. 2016-11-30T16:25:12Z\n* UTC RFC3339\
          \ shortened - without milliseconds and punctuation e.g. 20161130T162512Z\n\
          \nDate-time filtering supports three operators:\n\n* equality\n* greater\
          \ than or equal to &ndash; field name suffixed with ```__gte```\n* less\
          \ than or equal to &ndash; field name suffixed with ```__lte```\n\nLower\
          \ and upper limits to a date-time range may be specified by including both\
          \ the ```__gte``` and ```__lte``` forms in\nthe filter.\n```{field name}[|__lte|__gte]={UTC\
          \ RFC3339 date-time}```\n\n###### By device group custom attributes:\n\n\
          ```custom_attributes__{param}={value}```\n```custom_attributes__tag=TAG1```\n\
          \n##### Multi-field example\n\n```name__eq=mygroup&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z```\n\

          \n##### Filtering with filter operators\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n`name__in=group1,group2`"

          \ properties are filterable):\n\n```state=[unenrolled|cloud_enrolling|bootstrapped|registered]```\n\
          ```device_class={value}```\n\n###### On date-time fields:\n\nDate-time fields\
          \ should be specified in UTC RFC3339 format ```YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ```.\
          \ There are three permitted\nvariations:\n\n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds\
          \ e.g. 2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z\n* UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds e.g.\
          \ 2016-11-30T16:25:12Z\n* UTC RFC3339 shortened - without milliseconds and\
          \ punctuation e.g. 20161130T162512Z\n\nDate-time filtering supports three\
          \ operators:\n\n* equality\n* greater than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__gte```\n* less than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__lte```\n\nLower and upper limits to a date-time range\
          \ may be specified by including both the ```__gte``` and ```__lte``` forms\
          \ in the filter.\n```{field name}[|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}```\n\
          \n###### On device custom attributes:\n\n```custom_attributes__{param}={value}```\n\
          ```custom_attributes__tag=TAG1```\n\n##### Multi-field example\n\n```state=bootstrapped&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z```\n\
          \nEncoded:\n\n```?filter=state%3Dbootstrapped%26created_at__gte%3D2016-11-30T16%3A25%3A12.1234Z%26created_at__lte%3D2016-11-30T00%3A00%3A00Z```\n\
          \n##### Filtering with filter operators\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n`state__nin=unenrolled,dergistered`"

          \ should be specified in UTC RFC3339 format ```YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ```.\
          \ There are three permitted\nvariations:\n\n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds\

          \ 2016-11-30T16:25:12Z\n* UTC RFC3339 shortened - without milliseconds and\
          \ punctuation e.g. 20161130T162512Z\n\nDate-time filtering supports three\
          \ operators:\n\n* equality\n* greater than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__gte```\n* less than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__lte```\n\nLower and upper limits to a date-time range\
          \ may be specified by including both the ```__gte``` and ```__lte``` forms\
          \ in\nthe filter.\n```{field name}[|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}```\n\
          \n##### Multi-field example\n\n```query_id=0158d38771f70000000000010010038c&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z```\n\

          \n##### Filtering with filter operators\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\

          \ properties are filterable):\n\n```state=[unenrolled|cloud_enrolling|bootstrapped|registered]```\n\
          ```device_class={value}```\n\n###### On date-time fields:\n\nDate-time fields\
          \ should be specified in UTC RFC3339 format ```YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ```.\
          \ There are three permitted\nvariations:\n\n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds\
          \ e.g. 2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z\n* UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds e.g.\
          \ 2016-11-30T16:25:12Z\n* UTC RFC3339 shortened - without milliseconds and\
          \ punctuation e.g. 20161130T162512Z\n\nDate-time filtering supports three\
          \ operators:\n\n* equality\n* greater than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__gte```\n* less than or equal to &ndash; field name\
          \ suffixed with ```__lte```\n\nLower and upper limits to a date-time range\
          \ may be specified by including both the ```__gte``` and ```__lte``` forms\
          \ in the filter.\n```{field name}[|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}```\n\
          \n###### On device custom attributes:\n\n```custom_attributes__{param}={value}```\n\
          ```custom_attributes__tag=TAG1```\n\n##### Multi-field example\n\n```state=bootstrapped&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z```\n\

          \n##### Filtering with filter operators\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n`state__nin=unenrolled,dergistered`"

          \n\n**Filtering by properties**\n`hash__eq=8FS70vXrq5y1VxAAssUMAg==`\n\n\
          **Filtering on date-time fields**\n\nDate-time fields should be specified\
          \ in UTC RFC3339 format, `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ`. There are three permitted\
          \ variations:\n\n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z`\n\
          * UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12Z`\n* UTC\
          \ RFC3339 shortened without milliseconds and punctuation. Example: `20161130T162512Z`\n\
          \nDate-time filtering supports three operators:\n\n* equality by appending\
          \ `__eq` to the field name\n* greater than or equal to by appending `__gte`\
          \ to the field name\n* less than or equal to by appending `__lte` to the\
          \ field name\n\n`{field name}[|__eq|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}`\n\
          \nTime ranges may be specified by including both the `__gte` and `__lte`\
          \ forms in the filter. For example:\n\n`created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering on multiple fields**\n\n`status__eq=in_progress&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering with filter operators**\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n\n`status__in=in_progress,success`"

          \ key-value pairs separated by ampersands. For example, this query:\n`key1__eq=value1&key2__eq=value2&key3__eq=value3`\n\
          \nwould be URL-encoded as:\n`?filter=key1__eq%3Dvalue1%26key2__eq%3Dvalue2%26key3__eq%3Dvalue3`\n\
          \n\n**Filtering by properties**\n`name__eq=mymanifest`\n\n**Filtering on\
          \ date-time fields**\n\nDate-time fields should be specified in UTC RFC3339\
          \ format, `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ`. There are three permitted variations:\n\
          \n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z`\n\
          * UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12Z`\n* UTC\
          \ RFC3339 shortened without milliseconds and punctuation. Example: `20161130T162512Z`\n\
          \nDate-time filtering supports three operators:\n\n* equality by appending\
          \ `__eq` to the field name\n* greater than or equal to by appending `__gte`\
          \ to the field name\n* less than or equal to by appending `__lte` to the\
          \ field name\n\n`{field name}[|__eq|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}`\n\
          \nTime ranges may be specified by including both the `__gte` and `__lte`\
          \ forms in the filter. For example:\n\n`created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering on multiple fields**\n\n`name__eq=mymanifest&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering with filter operators**\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n\n`name__in=fw-manifest1,fw-manifest2`"

          \ on date-time fields**\n\nDate-time fields should be specified in UTC RFC3339\
          \ format, `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ`. There are three permitted variations:\n\
          \n* UTC RFC3339 with milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z`\n\
          * UTC RFC3339 without milliseconds. Example: `2016-11-30T16:25:12Z`\n* UTC\
          \ RFC3339 shortened without milliseconds and punctuation. Example: `20161130T162512Z`\n\
          \nDate-time filtering supports three operators:\n\n* equality by appending\
          \ `__eq` to the field name\n* greater than or equal to by appending `__gte`\
          \ to the field name\n* less than or equal to by appending `__lte` to the\
          \ field name\n\n`{field name}[|__eq|__lte|__gte]={UTC RFC3339 date-time}`\n\
          \nTime ranges may be specified by including both the `__gte` and `__lte`\
          \ forms in the filter. For example:\n\n`created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering on multiple fields**\n\n`state__eq=deployed&created_at__gte=2016-11-30T16:25:12.1234Z&created_at__lte=2016-12-30T00:00:00Z`\n\
          \n**Filtering with filter operators**\n\nString field filtering supports\
          \ the following operators:\n\n* equality: `__eq`\n* non-equality: `__neq`\n\
          * in : `__in`\n* not in: `__nin`\n\nFor `__in` and `__nin` filters list\
          \ of parameters must be comma-separated:\n\n`name__in=fw-image1,fw-image2`"
